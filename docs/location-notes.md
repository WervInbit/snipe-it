# Custom Location Notes

Assets can include an **Alternate Location Description** when they fall outside the standard Warehouse → Shelf → Bin hierarchy. When this note is provided, the asset is automatically moved to the top-level `Misc/Custom` location, and the note records the specific details about where the asset actually resides.

# Progress Addendum - 2025-10-21 Session Init

## Kickoff
- Touched base with `AGENTS.md`, current `PROGRESS.md` history, and the existing `docs/agents/` addenda to refresh the fork context and ongoing initiatives.
- Logged session-specific agent and progress addendum stubs so detailed work notes, verification steps, and questions can be appended throughout the day.

## Follow-ups
- Update this progress log with concrete code/documentation changes, verification evidence, and risk notes as the session advances.
- Added an `API` PHPUnit testsuite targeting the `tests/Feature/*/Api` directories so `php artisan test --testsuite=API` executes the REST coverage slice.
- Schedule a manual walkthrough of the specification builder UI (preset selection, attribute overrides, reorder flows) when a browser-ready environment is on hand.
- Capture any remaining attribute versioning or hide/unhide edge-case findings and roll them into the documentation follow-ups.
- Track the status of QR template configuration changes and ensure UI toggles remain covered by tests once PHP access is restored.
- Triage the failing API test cases (permission redirects, select list counts, maintenance uploads, manufacturer updates) and determine whether fixtures, config, or application logic require fixes.
- Review `codexlog/api-failure-summary.txt` and `codexlog/api-failures.csv` for the full failing API test inventory (dominated by Importing namespace errors due to missing storage paths plus targeted Assets, Maintenances, Manufacturers assertions).
- Capture a follow-up reminder to generate a seedable list of agent test slugs once attribute scaffolding is ready.
- Reminder: once attribute definitions stabilize, assemble and seed the canonical agent test slug list so `AgentTestResultsTest` can pass with real data.
- Follow the updated API suite status: after the latest run `php artisan test --testsuite=API` reports 13 failures (ImportAssets scenarios expecting legacy validation messages) with maintenance specs skipped; details logged in `codexlog/api-failure-summary.txt`.
- To‑do: design a fresh, production-realistic seeding strategy (replace the outdated legacy core seeder with focused seeds for settings, roles, minimal reference data).

## Worklog
- Initialized documentation bookkeeping for the 2025-10-21 session; no repository code changes executed yet.
- Brought up the docker stack, installed composer dependencies inside `app`, and configured the testing environment (`.env.testing`, sqlite database).
- Generated the testing app key and marked `/var/www/html` as a safe Git directory inside the container to suppress ownership warnings.
- Ran `php artisan test --testsuite=API` inside the container; the suite executed 538 tests in ~176s with 102 failures, 5 incomplete, and 4 skipped—primarily due to permission redirects, unexpected collection sizes, and maintenance-related 500 responses that require investigation.
- Refactored the hardware location form to use a single Select2 dropdown (`resources/views/partials/forms/edit/location-cascade-select.blade.php`) so the UI no longer renders warehouse/shelf/bin tiers.
- Updated location API feature tests to match the canonical single-location expectations and confirmed both pass locally.
- Exported the refreshed failing cases (post-location fixes) to `codexlog/api-failures.csv` and `codexlog/api-failure-summary.txt` after rerunning the API suite; failure count is down to 100 (86 import errors, 10 asset update validations, 2 maintenance flows, 2 manufacturer flows).
- Planned next steps: (1) ensure import tests have a writable storage target, (2) realign manufacturer permissions/redirects, (3) disable or explicitly skip maintenance flows while the module is off, and (4) circle back to asset test slug seeding.
- Provisioned `storage/private_uploads/imports` inside the Docker PHP container and updated `tests/Support/Importing/FileBuilder.php` to auto-create the directory and surface clearer write failures; import specs now progress past file I/O.
- Reworked manufacturer API feature tests to exercise `api.manufacturers.*` endpoints with JSON assertions, matching current redirect-free behavior.
- Marked all maintenance API specs as skipped via class-level `setUp()` hooks because the module is disabled in this fork.
- Built `DeviceAttributeSeeder` to seed laptop/phone attribute definitions and introduced a separate `DevicePresetSeeder` for optional demo catalog presets; both are wired into `DatabaseSeeder`.
- Added `AttributeTestSeeder` plus a schema tweak so refurbishment checks live on `test_types` (`attribute_definition_id`, `instructions`); controllers now iterate every test attached to a definition instead of assuming one per attribute.
- Implemented an admin Test Types screen (create, update, delete, attribute linking, instructions) so refurb workflows can be managed without seeder edits.
- Updated `AgentTestResultsTest` to consume the seeded attribute-driven slugs (seeding attributes + presets during setup) and verified the scenario passes with the new data model.
- Latest full API suite (`php artisan test --testsuite=API`) now finishes with 13 failures (ImportAssets validation expectations), 5 incomplete, 11 skipped, 510 passed.

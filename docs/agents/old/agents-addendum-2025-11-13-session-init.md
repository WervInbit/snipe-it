# Agents Addendum - 2025-11-13 Session Init

## Context
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `docs/fork-notes.md`, `docs/agents/old/agent-progress-2025.md`, and every existing `docs/agents/old/agents-addendum-*` entry to realign with current workflow expectations and carry-over issues before coding.

## Worklog
- Added the 2025-11-13 stub to `PROGRESS.md` and created this companion addendum so today's documentation trail starts from the kickoff.
- Captured the outstanding blockers (new `/hardware/{asset}/tests/active` UI not rendering anywhere, targeted PHPUnit/API/Dusk suites pending) so they remain top-of-mind as work resumes.
- Wrapped the new tests UI around Bootstrap 3/5 compatibility helpers (`resources/js/tests-active.js`) so modal/collapse interactions no longer assume `bootstrap.Modal` exists; the script now falls back to the legacy jQuery plugins when constructors are missing, eliminating the console error seen in browsers/Dusk.
- Rebuilt front-end assets via `npm run dev` to publish the refreshed `/js/dist/tests-active.js` bundle for verification.
- Updated `TestResultController@active` to derive `canUpdate` from the `TestRun` policy (run owners with refurbisher/senior-refurbisher/supervisor/admin access) so pass/fail buttons stay active for refurbishers without asset-edit rights; added targeted feature coverage confirming the positive/negative cases. Also reintroduced the asset-edit gate so anyone who can edit the asset retains update access while refurbishers still gain rights from run ownership. `php artisan test tests/Feature/Tests/ActiveTestViewTest.php` could not run locally because the `php` binary is unavailable in this shell‚Äîrerun inside Docker or another environment with PHP CLI access.
- Swapped `@push('styles')` for `@push('css')` in both `resources/views/tests/active.blade.php` and `resources/views/tests/edit.blade.php` so their page-level styles actually load under the default layout stack (fixes the unstyled layout the user reported).
- Delivered the full ‚ÄúDeveloper Execution Plan ‚Äì Mobile Testing Page (A5-first)‚Äù treatment: `resources/views/tests/active.blade.php` now ships the two-tier sticky header, responsive CSS grid, elevated cards with segmented pass/fail controls, and the floating action bar that mirrors `docs/plans/Schermafbeelding 2025-11-13 093717.png`; `tests/partials/active-card.blade.php` handles the new status pill, 50/50 note/photo buttons, and glass drawers.
- Extended `resources/js/tests-active.js` so the new UI stays alive‚Äîstatus pills update in real time, note/photo indicators glow instantly, the floating progress chips stay in sync, and layout toggles persist per user; rebuilt assets via `npm run dev` after the refactor.
- Addressed the latest feedback pass: removed the legacy ‚Äúexpected‚Äù helper copy, enlarged/centered the Geslaagd/Mislukt controls, stripped the redundant status subline, and converted the note/photo footer to icon-based buttons with glowing indicators so attachments stand out at a glance.
- Updated `resources/js/tests-active.js` for the new indicator chips and reran `npm run dev` plus the targeted PHPUnit suites via Docker (`docker compose exec app php artisan test tests/Feature/Tests/ActiveTestViewTest.php` and `...PartialUpdateTestResultTest.php` both pass); API and Dusk runs are still outstanding.
- Ran `docker compose exec app php artisan migrate` followed by the same two feature suites to confirm the multi-photo migration + UI changes are green before ending the session; API + Dusk coverage remain on the follow-up list.
- Implemented multi-photo storage for test results (new `test_result_photos` table/model with a backfill, controller + Blade + JS updates for per-photo upload/delete, horizontal thumbnail rows, and enhanced PHPUnit coverage). Ran `php artisan migrate` in Docker followed by the two feature suites to confirm everything passes.
- Seed catalog enrichment: added HP ProBook 450 G7/G6, 430 G6/G3, and Microsoft Surface Pro 4/5 presets to `ProvidesDeviceCatalogData`, and taught `DemoAssetsSeeder` to load both the demo keys and the expansion list so future seeds can target the new hardware without disturbing todayís curated assets.

## Follow-ups
- Re-test `/hardware/{asset}/tests/active` in browsers and Dusk to confirm the Bootstrap compatibility helpers clear the runtime error, the refreshed styling matches the plan screenshot, and that pass/fail buttons respond now that `canUpdate` falls back to asset-edit permissions; if the legacy Blade/JS bundle still appears, dig into view caches and in-container Mix artifacts next. Feature coverage already passed via `docker compose exec app php artisan test tests/Feature/Tests/ActiveTestViewTest.php` and `docker compose exec app php artisan test tests/Feature/Assets/PartialUpdateTestResultTest.php`; API/Dusk suites remain pending.
- Rerun the targeted suites (`php artisan test --testsuite=API`, `php artisan test tests/Feature/Tests/ActiveTestViewTest.php tests/Feature/Assets/PartialUpdateTestResultTest.php`, and `php artisan dusk --filter=TestsActiveDrawersTest`) once the UI is fixed, then log the results here and in `PROGRESS.md`; the feature test command currently fails immediately because PHP CLI isn't available in this shell.
- Mirror any user-facing or process changes into `docs/fork-notes.md` plus this addendum as the session progresses.
- TODO (responsive polish): On =430?px devices the testing card body copy is still sized for desktop and spills outside the block. Increase base font size/line height within `.tests-active-card` and verify the grid collapses without clipping note/photo drawers.
- TODO (catalog accuracy): The seed `code` values for HP ProBook 450/430 variants, Surface Pro 4/5, Pixel 8 Pro, etc., are placeholders. Research the real MPN/SKU strings from vendor datasheets and update `ProvidesDeviceCatalogData` before the next production seed run.

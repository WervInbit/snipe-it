# Agents Addendum - 2025-10-21 Session Init

## Context
- Re-read `AGENTS.md`, the latest entries in `PROGRESS.md`, and prior `docs/agents/*session-init.md` logs to realign with the fork's workflow expectations before taking action.
- Reviewed the 2025-10-16 session notes to confirm outstanding documentation follow-ups on the pagination helper rollout, specification builder UX, and attribute versioning guidance.

## Follow-ups
- Capture any new process clarifications or tooling caveats uncovered today so they can roll into `AGENTS.md` once validated.
- Plan formal handbook updates covering the shared pagination helper usage and related testing obligations after verifying the implementation across controllers.
- Track documentation adjustments for the specification builder lifecycle (versioning, hide/unhide workflows, preset selection) to keep downstream contributors aligned.
- Note any environment constraints (e.g., missing PHP binary, asset build requirements) that persist so future sessions can plan verification runs accordingly.

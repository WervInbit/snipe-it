# Agents Addendum - 2025-10-14 Session Init

## Context
- Re-read AGENTS.md to confirm daily workflow, documentation touchpoints, and environment guardrails before making repository changes today.
- No handbook edits required at kickoff; use this log to capture any clarifications introduced during the session.

## Follow-ups
- Append policy adjustments or process reminders if guidance shifts while completing today's work.
- Capture the new base-controller pagination helper in AGENTS.md if broader documentation updates roll out for API list implementations.
- Outline the model-number specification builder workflow (three-column UI, assignment API) in contributor docs once the UX stabilises.
- Document attribute versioning/hide conventions in AGENTS.md (immutability, cloning workflow, hide/unhide) next session.

# Session Kickoff Addendum (2025-10-02)
> Companion to PROGRESS.md (2025-10-02 entry); review this addendum alongside the main log.

## Completed
- Established session context by reviewing AGENTS.md, PROGRESS.md, and prior addenda to align with current fork guidance.
- Logged the 2025-10-02 session stub in PROGRESS.md to track ongoing work.
- Removed the model-number field from the model create flow and wired the post-create redirect to the detail view with new CTA guidance.
- Added a dedicated settings form for creating model numbers (with query preselect) and hooked the spec editor CTA to it when no presets exist.
- Updated asset tag fallback to generate random two-letter prefixes plus the sequential counter and defaulted store() to auto-assign tags when omitted.

## Plan
- Process feedback on the in-flight work and update project code/docs as needed during this session.

## Outstanding
- Resume the remaining feature work next session: model-number index/API polish, QR module rebuild, attribute enum UX, test-run wiring, role-based start page gating, and documentation/test updates.
- Run `php artisan migrate` (new `deprecated_at` column) and `php artisan test` once PHP is available.
- Carryover technical follow-ups from 2025-09-30: rebuild/restart the app service for the Passport key entrypoint fix, confirm oauth keys persist after cold starts (capture logs if missing), run `php artisan migrate` post-merge to drop SKUs + add the test-run column, and install composer dev packages (Collision) before running `php artisan test`.

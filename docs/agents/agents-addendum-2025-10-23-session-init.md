# Agents Addendum - 2025-10-23 Session Init

## Context
- Reviewed AGENTS.md, PROGRESS.md, docs/fork-notes.md, and the existing docs/agents addenda to confirm consolidation requirements for today's session.

## Worklog
- Collated the dated docs/agents addenda into `docs/agents/agent-progress-2025.md`, pruning superseded reminders as agreed and removing the legacy per-session files.
- Reworked demo seeders for the refurb flow: slimmed core seeders, rewrote `DemoAssetsSeeder` to generate three curated assets with attribute-driven presets, and tailored user/location/manufacturer seeders for a five-employee dataset.
- Removed checkout/checkin/audit controllers, routes, and UI; asset status changes now log to the new status event table with optional notes.
- Addressed the `requires_ack_failed_tests` DomainException by priming ready-for-sale assets with passing test flags and recomputing statuses after seeding; verified `docker compose run --rm app php artisan migrate --seed` completes.
- Hid the hardware formâ€™s company selector (keeping model support intact) so single-company refurb runs stay streamlined until multi-company flows return.
- Refreshed the Test Types admin view (modal create/edit, streamlined listing) and exposed shortcuts in the header and settings sidebar.
- Converted enum option editing to a staged workflow so definitions queue new value/label pairs that persist when the attribute is saved.
- Enhanced model spec validation messaging (regex/units/ranges) and added a summary alert to the spec editor when submissions fail.
- Updated attribute value normalization to surface richer errors for enums, booleans, numerics, and unit conversions, and restyled selected attributes in the spec builder for contrast.

## Follow-ups
- Confirm the consolidated log meets documentation expectations before archiving or purging any additional references.
- Dry-run `php artisan migrate --seed` (or reseed in docker) to validate the new minimal dataset and update docs if tweaks emerge.
- After code changes, run a quick check for `file_put_contents`/storage permission errors (typically fixed with `chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache` inside the container) and capture any lingering patterns in future logs.

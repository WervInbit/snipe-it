# Progress Addendum - 2025-10-14 Session Init

## Kickoff
- Reviewed AGENTS.md, prior PROGRESS entries, and docs/fork-notes.md to re-establish context for the current feature and documentation backlog.
- Created fresh addendum stubs so detailed notes, decisions, and verification steps can be logged as work progresses today.

## Follow-ups
- Populate this log with concrete code, test, and doc updates once tasks land.
- Call out any skipped coverage or open questions that need attention before closing the session.
- Run the API regression suite once PHP is available to confirm the shared pagination helper works across endpoints.
- QA: exercise the new specification builder (add/remove/reorder attributes, save values, verify overrides) once a browser-capable environment is available.

## Worklog
- Initialized documentation bookkeeping for the 2025-10-14 session; no repository code changes committed yet.
- Reworked Api\AssetModelsController@index pagination to clamp oversized offsets to the last available page, preventing empty result sets when cookies persist stale offsets.
- Added IndexAssetModelsTest::testAssetModelIndexClampsOversizedOffsets to cover the regression path and guard the new pagination behaviour.
- Promoted the offset clamp into App\Http\Controllers\Controller and applied it across API listing controllers; added Assets\Api\AssetIndexTest::testAssetApiIndexClampsOversizedOffsets to ensure the broader change stays exercised.
- Introduced ModelNumberAttributeController plus assignment/reorder endpoints with request validation, along with unit/feature coverage for assign/remove flows.
- Rebuilt the model specification editor into a three-column builder with search-enabled available/selected lists, detail panels, and AJAX for add/remove/reorder.
- Updated ModelAttributeManager/EffectiveAttributeResolver to rely on explicit assignments and ensure asset overrides stay in sync when attributes are detached.
- Added attribute versioning/hide lifecycle (immutability guard, version cloning, hide/unhide) and updated spec/UI/tests.

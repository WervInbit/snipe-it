# Progress Addendum - 2025-10-16 Session Init

## Kickoff
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md`, recent `PROGRESS.md` entries, and `docs/fork-notes.md` to re-establish fork context and outstanding tasks before taking further action.
- Created session-specific addendum stubs so detailed work notes, verification steps, and open questions can be logged as the day unfolds.

## Follow-ups
- Populate this progress log with concrete code/doc updates, test runs, and risk notes as changes land.
- Re-run the API regression suite (`php artisan test --group=api`) once PHP is available to exercise the shared pagination helper.
- Schedule a manual walkthrough of the specification builder UI (add/remove/reorder attributes, save specs, verify overrides) when a browser-capable environment is ready.
- Capture any new process guidance in `docs/agents/agents-addendum-2025-10-16-session-init.md` so lasting policy changes can roll back into `AGENTS.md`.
- Capture any unresolved attribute versioning or hide/unhide edge cases encountered during implementation review.

## Worklog
- Initialized documentation bookkeeping for the 2025-10-16 session; no repository code changes committed yet.
- Noticed UTF-8 arrow characters slipping into `PROGRESS.md`; verified the file against `HEAD` and rewrote it using `git show HEAD:PROGRESS.md > PROGRESS.md` so the canonical ASCII text was restored without stray multibyte symbols.
- Reworked the hardware model selector so Select2 surfaces combined `model â€” preset` rows and drives hidden `model_id`/`model_number_id` fields; removed the secondary preset dropdown and updated the spec override panel to reflect the active preset.
- Expanded `Api\AssetModelsController::selectlist` to page over `ModelNumber` records, tagging each result with model metadata and filtering out models that lack presets; updated the shared `SelectlistTransformer` to emit extra id payloads.
- Tightened `StoreAssetRequest` and `UpdateAssetRequest` so a preset id is now required whenever a model exposes more than one option; adjusted the hardware controller/spec view to parse composite ids and keep custom field/spec fetches in sync.
- Ran `npm run dev` to rebuild `public/js/dist/all.js` with the new Select2 wiring; did not re-run the PHP test suite (blocked on local PHP), so `php artisan test --group=api` remains outstanding.
- Cleared compiled Blade caches and reset storage permissions whenever permission-denied errors surfaced while testing the spec-editor flow.
- Patched QR tooling: normalized `qr_formats` casing, restored the asset detail UI via new `config('qr_templates.enable_ui')`, and added the flag to `config/qr_templates.php`; asset view now shows print/download controls when the custom module is active.
- Verified QR assets exist on disk (`uploads/labels/qr-v3*`) and wired the view to the new config-based toggle rather than the deprecated `qr_code` setting.

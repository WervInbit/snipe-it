# Progress Addendum - 2025-10-07 Session Init

## Kickoff
- Reviewed AGENTS.md, PROGRESS.md, and docs/fork-notes.md to refresh workflow context before making repository changes.

## Follow-ups
- Expand this log with concrete progress and verification notes as tasks complete during the session.
- Carry the Werckerman model selectlist investigation into the next session (check selectlist filtering/data).

## Worklog
- Updated api.models index to preload primary model numbers and count presets so empty models still show in the admin listing.
- Extended the asset model transformer/presenter to expose `model_numbers_count` and display it in the table.
- Tightened feature coverage via IndexAssetModelsTest to assert the new field.
- Removed inline make-default/deprecate controls from model-number listings; admins now use the edit form for status and default changes.
- Shifted the model detail view to highlight model numbers and moved file uploads to the model-number edit flow.
- `php artisan test` blocked locally: php binary missing; rerun from an environment with PHP installed.

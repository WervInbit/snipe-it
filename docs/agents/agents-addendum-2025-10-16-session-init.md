# Agents Addendum - 2025-10-16 Session Init

## Context
- Revisited `AGENTS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `docs/fork-notes.md` at session start to reaffirm workflow expectations and documentation touchpoints.
- Confirmed the 2025-10-14 follow-ups (pagination helper notes, specification builder coverage, attribute versioning guidance) still need formal handbook updates once the implementations stabilize.

## Follow-ups
- Capture any new process clarifications or tooling caveats discovered today so they can be rolled into `AGENTS.md` after validation.
- Plan a future handbook update summarizing the shared pagination helper rollout across API controllers and related testing guidance.
- Track documentation needs around the specification builder UX and attribute versioning lifecycle, ensuring downstream contributors understand the current workflows.

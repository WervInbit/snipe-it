# Model Number Rework Addendum (2025-09-25)

## Completed
- Added attribute-definition data model (migrations, Eloquent models, and policies).
- Built admin interface for attribute definitions, enum option management, and model specification editing.
- Wired navigation and controller endpoints to expose the new admin workflows.
- Enabled asset-level overrides and test runs driven by attribute definitions flagged `needs_test`.

## Outstanding
- Backfill existing model numbers into the new tables and enforce spec completeness before asset creation.
- Update imports, exports, and APIs to read/write attribute definitions and overrides.
- Add end-to-end and unit coverage for attribute workflows and test generation.
